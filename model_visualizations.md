# Model Data Visualization Guide

This document explains the visualizations generated by `visualize_models.py`. These charts help you explain **how the data was processed** (Before) and **how the models performed** (After).

## 1. Data Analysis (Before Training)

### Feature Distributions (Histograms)
**Example**: `diabetes_distributions.png`
-   **What it shows**: The frequency of different values for each feature (e.g., Age, Glucose).
-   **Why it matters**: Helps identify data skewness. For instance, if 'Insulin' has many zero values, it indicates missing data (as 0 is biologically impossible for insulin).

### Correlation Heatmap
**Example**: `diabetes_correlation.png`, `heart_correlation.png`
-   **What it shows**: The relationship between different variables.
    -   **Red (+1.0)**: Strong positive correlation (e.g., Prediction vs. Glucose).
    -   **Blue (-1.0)**: Strong negative correlation.
-   **Key Insight**: In the Heart Disease map, look for the correlation between 'target' and 'cp' (Chest Pain) or 'thalach' (Max Heart Rate) — these are usually strong predictors.

## 2. Model Evaluation (After Training)

### Confusion Matrix
**Example**: `diabetes_confusion_matrix.png`
-   **What it shows**: The comparison between **Actual** values (Y-axis) and **Predicted** values (X-axis).
    -   **Top-Left**: True Negatives (Correctly predicted Healthy).
    -   **Bottom-Right**: True Positives (Correctly predicted Disease).
    -   **Top-Right**: False Positives (Type I Error).
    -   **Bottom-Left**: False Negatives (Type II Error - Critical in medical apps!).
-   **Interpretation**: High numbers on the diagonal are good.

### Feature Importance (Random Forest)
**Example**: `diabetes_feature_importance.png`
-   **What it shows**: Which features contributed most to the Random Forest model's decision.
-   **Why it matters**: Explains **"Why"** the model made a decision.
    -   **Diabetes**: 'Glucose' and 'BMI' are usually the tallest bars.
    -   **Heart**: 'Chest Pain' (cp) and 'Thal' are often key drivers.

## How to Run the Visualization Script
1.  Ensure you have `matplotlib` and `seaborn` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib seaborn
    ```
2.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python3 visualize_models.py
    ```
3.  Check the `visualizations` folder for the images.
